![](https://github.com/Carbine28/Game-to-Teach-3D-Transformation/blob/main/gameDemo.gif)

A game built in the Godot game engine designed to teach the player about 3D transformations (translation, rotation, scale) by manipulating obstacles.

# Features
- Manipulate obstacles by moving (translation), rotating (rotation), resizing (scaling) the obstacles in the way.
- 6 levels, each level teaches a player a new mechanic. Further levels are longer and are more challenging. Early levels ease the player into the game and its mechanics.
- Score system based on how fast you complete the level.

# Installation
